TeamKang(AOKP) (spanner3003)
 ===========
 
 Getting Started
 ---------------
 
To get started with Android/AOKP, you'll need to get
 familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).
 
To initialize your local repository using the TeamKang's trees, use a command like this:
 
     repo init -u git://github.com/spanner3003/android.git -b aokp
 
 Then to sync up:
 
     repo sync
 
 Building
 --------
 
After the sync is finished, please read the [instructions from the Android site](http://s.android.com/source/building.html) on how to build.
 
Once you've read that, you can build with
 
    mka
 
This will compile everything and use the correct "-j#" flag.
 
You can also build a flashable zip with
 
    mka otapackage
